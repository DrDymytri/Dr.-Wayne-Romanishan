  <!-- Personal Story -->
  <section id="story">
    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      I began my career with steel, sweat, and fire. For decades, I worked in fabrication and engineering design — managing complex projects, training apprentices, and learning firsthand how people and systems succeed or fail. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the way, I saw a troubling pattern: disengagement, burnout, and wasted resources were not accidents — they were built into the very design of our organizations. That insight led me to pursue advanced studies in psychology and leadership, earning my Doctorate in Human and Organizational Psychology with a specialization in Organizational Leadership and Algorithmic Psychology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I combine the precision of engineering with the depth of psychology to do more than consult. I provide systemic solutions that make organizations — and the people within them — truly resilient.

  <!-- Philosophy -->
  <section id="philosophy">
    <h2>My Epiphany</h2>
    <p>
      Business as usual is broken. The old ideology — grow the core, expand endlessly, maximize profit at any cost — is unsustainable for corporations, communities, or the planet.  
    </p>
    <p>
      We must replace throwaway goods and disposable talent with systems that reduce waste, extend the life of products, and honor the human need for purpose. Profit must come not from overproduction, but from <strong>resilience</strong>: minimizing loss, reducing inefficiency, and aligning work with meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      This realization drives my work as a <strong>Solutionist</strong>. I help organizations redesign their workforce, workflows, and strategies around long-term resilience — not short-term metrics.

  <!-- The Romanishan Workforce Resilience Model -->
  <section id="model">
    <h2>The Romanishan Workforce Resilience Model (RWRM)</h2>
    <p>
      My doctoral research revealed how unprepared organizations were for generational transitions in the workplace. Out of this research, I developed the Romanishan Workforce Resilience Model (RWRM) — a framework that shifts organizations from fragile engagement models to sustainable resilience systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      RWRM rests on four pillars:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Algorithmic Alignment</strong> – Systems that anticipate and prevent disengagement triggers.</li>
      <li><strong>Purpose Capital</strong> – Embedding meaning as a currency of motivation.</li>
      <li><strong>Adaptive Fear Reset</strong> – Replacing destructive fear with constructive challenge.</li>
      <li><strong>Generational Flow Integration</strong> – Turning generational diversity into organizational strength.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Together, these pillars create resilient organizations where employees thrive, waste is minimized, and profits are sustainable.

    <p>
      I believe resilience is the true measure of organizational success. My mission is to help companies move beyond outdated survey-driven engagement tactics and toward systems that integrate people, processes, and sustainability.
