  <section class="concept-section">
    <h2>Work Is Not Broken, Reciprocity Is</h2>
    <p>
      The modern enterprise extracts more energy than it restores. The result: exhaustion, cynicism, 
      and turnover disguised as “change.” The <strong>Reciprocity Engine™</strong> decodes these 
      imbalances through a cognitive, behavioral, and algorithmic framework that measures the 
      <em>flow of energy, trust, and meaning</em> across the enterprise.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Core Concept -->
  <section class="concept-section">
    <h2>The Balance Behind Performance</h2>
    <p>
      Every organization is a network of human energies: psychological, emotional, and structural. 
      When these forces move in harmony, performance becomes effortless. When one side overdraws, 
      the entire system destabilizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reciprocity Engine™ identifies three invisible variables behind every success or failure:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Energy Flow:</strong> The movement of effort, motivation, and renewal across roles.</li>
      <li><strong>Perceptual Accuracy:</strong> The alignment between what people believe they contribute and what they truly deliver.</li>
      <li><strong>Restorative Equilibrium:</strong> The organization’s capacity to restore energy faster than it depletes it.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Integration with Seven Domains -->
  <section class="integration-section">
    <h2>Integration Across All MDOA Service Domains</h2>
    <p>
      The Reciprocity Engine™ functions as the connective tissue across MDOA’s seven disciplines, 
      ensuring each contributes to measurable equilibrium between purpose and performance:
    </p>
    <div class="grid-2">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Organizational Development</strong>: Align structures with the flow of human and system energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Human Factors Engineering</strong>: Synchronize digital and human interaction to reduce cognitive friction.</li>
        <li><strong>Talent Management</strong>: Rebuild engagement and retention around reciprocal purpose rather than extraction.</li>
        <li><strong>Engineering Workflow Management</strong>: Remove systemic friction that drains productivity and morale.</li>
        <li><strong>Document Management</strong>: Sustain integrity of shared truth and eliminate energy leaks from fragmentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Change Management</strong>: Transform leadership from directive authority to responsive coherence.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithmic Psychology</strong>: Quantify and visualize human energy restoration and perception bias.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Reciprocity Quotient Interactive Gauge -->
  <section class="rq-section">
    <h2>Reciprocity Quotient (RQ)</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>RQ Gauge</strong> represents the dynamic balance between 
      human energy contribution and corporate reciprocity. 
      The displayed value is illustrative and does not represent diagnostic output. 
      Actual calculations are proprietary to MDOA Solutions.

  <!-- Confidential Framework -->
  <section class="confidential-section">
    <h2>How It Works (At a Glance)</h2>
    <p>
      The Reciprocity Engine™ integrates psychometric diagnostics, behavioral analytics, and 
      systems data into a unified measure, the <strong>Reciprocity Quotient (RQ)</strong>. 
      A higher RQ signifies reduced burnout, higher trust, and faster adaptation cycles.
    </p>

      The algorithms, calibration matrices, and neural reciprocity mapping models are proprietary 
      to MDOA Solutions and available exclusively under non-disclosure agreement.
