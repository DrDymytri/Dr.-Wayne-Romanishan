    <section class="AboutMe">
      <div class="AboutMe-Page">
        <p class="AboutMe--desc">
          I come from a lineage deeply rooted in hands-on, blue-collar
          industries—born to a business owner in metal fabrication, the grandson
          of a farmer and cattle distributor, and the great-grandson of a
          Ukrainian potato farmer. This upbringing gave me an intimate
          understanding of operational efficiency, safety, and the importance of
          optimizing processes. The ethos of "working smarter, not harder" was
          instilled early in my life, and while this concept holds true in
          physically demanding jobs, it requires a more nuanced approach in
          white-collar environments, particularly when considering human
          psychology and workplace dynamics. <br /><br />

          As we witness the rapid integration of AI, machine learning, and
          autonomous equipment—epitomizing the ultimate "work smarter"
          philosophy—we also face the challenge of maintaining human engagement.
          These technological advances, while valuable, can unintentionally lead
          to boredom, frustration, and a lack of purpose among employees. This
          is where Corporate Workplace Psychology comes into play. <br /><br />

          My initial passion for engineering gave me an invaluable understanding
          of business operations, systems efficiency, and the technical
          underpinnings of industries. However, as I progressed in my career, I
          realized that understanding the human side of business—why companies
          fail, why layoffs happen despite individual performance, and why
          leadership decisions can often seem detached—was equally, if not more,
          important. I found myself returning to school to formally study
          investigation, analysis, and the psychology of work. <br /><br />

          Through this journey, I discovered that my natural analytical skills
          were perfectly suited for workplace psychology. The drive to
          understand why individuals and organizations behave the way they do,
          and how to influence positive change, led me to pursue a PsyD in
          Corporate Workplace Psychology, also known as
          Industrial-Organizational Psychology. This path allowed me to apply
          both my technical and human-centered knowledge to help companies
          cultivate work environments that are not only productive but
          fulfilling for employees. <br /><br />

          With experience across multiple industries and roles, I have developed
          programs that assist organizations in navigating the increasingly
          complex and emotionally charged nature of modern business. There is no
          one-size-fits-all solution—every company, division, and department
          operates with its own unique dynamics. The key lies in understanding
          those dynamics and addressing the underlying human factors that drive
          both success and dysfunction in today’s workplace. <br /><br />

          My goal is to help organizations unlock the potential of their
          workforce by fostering an environment where employees feel valued,
          engaged, and motivated to contribute to the collective success of the
          company. Together, we can address the unique challenges of your
          workplace and transform it into a space where both individuals and the
          business thrive.
