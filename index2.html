    <p>
      The RWRM is a proprietary framework that helps organizations shift from fragile, survey-driven engagement to lasting workforce resilience.  
      Its four pillars — Algorithmic Alignment, Purpose Capital, Adaptive Fear Reset, and Generational Flow Integration — align people, processes, and profits for long-term sustainability.
